The following code snippet demonstrates a common issue when using Firebase's Realtime Database:  data persistence issues. Specifically, this example shows how unexpected behavior can occur when attempting to retrieve data after the app is closed and reopened.  The issue arises from the fact that cached data may be returned by Firebase instead of up-to-date server data, particularly if the network connection is unreliable or absent on app restart.

```javascript
// buggy code
firebase.database().ref('/myData').on('value', function(snapshot) {
  console.log(snapshot.val()); // May display outdated data
});
```
